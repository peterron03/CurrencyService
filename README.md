# CurrencyService
A Currency system for Roblox, built using the Knit framework.

## What is CurrencyService?
To put it simply, CurrencyService is a server-sided table of data that you can add to, remove from, or get from. It allows for multiple currencies all in one place and easy organization to deal with. CurrencyService is by no means a top-tier must-have, but it's something I made for myself and decided to share with the world for anyone that might find it interesting or useful.

## What is Knit?
As stated in the very short description of InventoryService, Knit is used as a dependency. If you're unfamiliar with Knit, I highly suggest watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ty2ojfdOnA) video, which is a tutorial made by [@sleitnick](https://github.com/Sleitnick), the creator of Knit. Though CurrencyService can be used without much knowledge of Knit, it's recommended you understand Knit first.
